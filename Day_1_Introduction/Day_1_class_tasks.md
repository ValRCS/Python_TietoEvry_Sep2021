## Write the following code in Python:

* print your name 5 times
* print Bananananana using "Ba" once and "na" 5 times
* print the number of seconds in a year calculated from months, days, minutes, seconds
* how much a googol is that is 10 to the power of the 100th
* how much will your 1000 Euro investment be worth after 12 years of 6% yearly interest?

* You can submit a .py file or a link to your code repository on Github.

Alternatives would be a link to pastebin.com, pastebin.pl or similar code paste tool.

As a last resort you can submit code through text, but that is not recommended.
